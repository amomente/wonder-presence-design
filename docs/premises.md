# Foundational Premises

These five premises are the non-negotiable starting points for designing within the Wonder Size framework.

1. **Impartial Designer** – The designer must neutralize personal biases and body judgments, approaching each body as valid. This requires empathetic observation and active listening instead of projecting normative standards.
2. **Body as Starting Point** – The body is not an obstacle to contain or hide but a territory of freedom. Design begins with real bodies through body mapping, affective ergonomics and co‑creation with users.
3. **Sensorial Disappearance** – The ideal garment creates no cognitive noise. By optimizing fabric, cut and fit, it disappears from conscious awareness, freeing the wearer to focus on life rather than discomfort.
4. **Emotional Longevity** – Success is measured by how often a piece is chosen because it provides autonomy, security and affection. Design for deep, lasting bonds rather than trends.
5. **Immediate Benefits** – Garments must deliver tangible benefits through intelligent materials and technology, addressing the scarcity of time and enhancing wellbeing in daily life.
